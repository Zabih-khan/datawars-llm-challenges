# Evaluation Metrics for RAG Chunking

## Objective
The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the chunking strategy used for processing video transcripts to ensure high relevance, correctness, and cost efficiency.

## Metrics

### 1. Relevancy
- **Definition:** The degree to which each chunk retains meaningful and contextually coherent information.
- **Evaluation:** Check if chunks include full ideas or concepts rather than splitting them inappropriately. This can be tested by querying the vector store and assessing the relevance of retrieved chunks.

### 2. Correctness
- **Definition:** The ability of each chunk to accurately represent the content of the transcript without omitting critical information.
- **Evaluation:** Compare the chunks against the original transcript to ensure important details are not lost or fragmented.

### 3. Cost Efficiency
- **Definition:** The computational and financial cost of processing and querying chunks.
- **Evaluation:** Analyze the token usage for various chunk sizes and overlaps. A balance between chunk size and overlap should minimize token costs while retaining information.

## Challenges Faced
- Balancing between large chunk sizes for cost efficiency and smaller chunks for better accuracy and relevance.
- Ensuring that overlapping text does not introduce redundancy or confusion.

## Conclusion
The chosen strategy of chunking by character length with overlap should provide a good balance, but further testing and adjustments may be necessary based on the evaluation results.




# Why this strategy works:
Chunk size and overlap: 500 characters is a typical sweet spot for LLM models to process. It keeps chunks small enough to avoid exceeding token limits but large enough to retain context. The overlap helps ensure that even if a relevant part of the text spans two chunks, both chunks contain enough information to remain useful for retrieval.



Why I Chose Length-Based and Sentence Boundary Chunking in Your Case:
Simplicity and Efficiency:

You want to build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that can answer questions. Using fixed chunk sizes is an efficient way to manage token costs and ensure each chunk fits into the LLM's token limits.
Sentence boundary chunking provides a nice balance of coherence and ease of implementation.
Overhead and Timeline:

Implementing more complex similarity-based chunking would require additional time for creating embeddings and clustering the text, which could be an overkill for relatively simple text like video transcripts.
Maximum/Minimum Chunk Size:

I recommended a maximum chunk size of 500 because this strikes a good balance between providing enough context for retrieval while staying well within typical LLM token limits (like GPT-3, which has a 4,000-token limit).
The overlap of 50 ensures some context is preserved between chunks, so sentences donâ€™t get cut off between chunks, preserving meaning
