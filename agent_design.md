# Agent Workflow

## 1. User Input
The student inputs a question, such as "How do I group a DataFrame in Pandas?"

## 2. Query the Vector Store
The agent retrieves the most relevant transcript chunks using similarity search based on embeddings.

## 3. Generate a Response
The agent combines the retrieved transcript chunks and user query into the final prompt for the language model to generate an answer.

## 4. Present the Answer
The agent provides the student with a concise answer and includes the video title and timestamp for further reference.
