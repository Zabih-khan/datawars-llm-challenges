# Educational Assistant Agent for Pandas and Matplotlib

This document outlines the steps and prompts for creating an educational assistant agent designed to help students with questions about Pandas and Matplotlib tutorials. The agent will leverage a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide accurate and relevant answers.

## Step 1: Initialize LLM

- Set up the language model (LLM) using the OpenAI API or any preferred model.

## Step 2: Create and Load Chunks

- Chunk the video transcripts into manageable pieces and load them for processing.

## Step 3: Create Embeddings and Vector Database

- Generate embeddings for the chunks and store them in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

## Step 4: Set Up Retriever for Document Search

- Configure the retriever to search and fetch relevant chunks based on user queries.

## Step 5: Create the Prompt Template for the LLM

```python
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """
    You are an assistant for answering questions based on educational content about Pandas and Matplotlib. Use the following pieces of context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, state that you don't know. Keep your answer concise and relevant to the question.

    Question: {input}

    Context: {context}

    Answer:

    """
)

```
## Step 6: Implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chain

**Retrieve Context:** Use the vector store to fetch relevant chunks based on the user's query.
**Generate Response:** Use the LLM to generate an answer based on the retrieved context and the defined prompts.
